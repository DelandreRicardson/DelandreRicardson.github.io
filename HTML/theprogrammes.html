  <h1 class="ColumnMain">Programmes</h1>
  <h2>Stage No. 1: Application and Interview</h2>
  <p>
    To apply to the programme you must first fill out an application form, ensuring that you fill all parts correctly and truthfully.
    Once that is done HQ will review your application and, if you are a rockstar on paper, invite you to do an interview with either a member of staff or your local campus manager.
    These interviews are informal but informative meetings that allow us to get to know you and your skills better so that we can ensure you have the strongest application possible and that we have the correct information about you to match you up with the right camp.
    At this stage you will need to pay the first payment towards your programme fee before your interview.
  </p>
  <h2>Stage No. 2: Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    Once the interview is done you will be told to write a creative personal essay and get two references forms completed.
    The essay is an essential part of your application.
    It is how the Camp Directors in Canada will get to know what kind of person you are on a personal level so make sure you talk about your skills and include a few photos of you doing them.
    The references cannot be from friends or family members and must contain active contact details so we can verify them.
    Teachers, employers or coaches are the best references to fill out the forms.
  </p>
  <h2>Stage No. 3: Placement and Visa</h2>
  <p>
    This part of the process is when we work hard to match you with the best camp for you and then get you prepared to make your way to Canada.
    You will either be placed through our system or at one of our Camp Fairs.
    These fairs are great opportunities to have more control over the camp you will be placed at and have the possibility to be placed with a friend.
    At these fairs you will meet face to face with the Camp Directors and show off your amazing personality and brag about your skills.
    Once you have been placed it is now time to make your final payment, get your medical and visa and book your flights.
    You do NOT have to attend an embassy interview to obtain your visa (unless you are planning to get the one year holiday visa or your camp says other wise).
    Visas are done online and you get it when you go through customs in Canada.
    Flights are quite easy too and we can get you in contact with our flight partner to help you book them.
    It is best to apply early so you can get placed earlier, book flights earlier and get a cheaper rate.
  </p>
  <h2>General Camp counsellor</h2>
  <p>
    General Camp Counsellors are the lifeblood of any camp.
    As a Camp Counsellor, you will be responsible for waking your campers in the morning (and ensuring they go to bed), making sure they get to meals on time, getting involved with all the crazy activities and to be an all-round great role model.
    For General Camp Counsellor roles you do not need any specific experience or skill set in any given activity, however, you must be a charismatic all-rounder that loves working with children.
    Experience of working with children is definitely a bonus in this role!
  </p>
  <h2>Activities Counsellor</h2>
  <p>
    Activity Counsellors are usually skilled and experienced in a particular activity and will directly instruct or assist with the campers.
    You will usually teach in your field during the day, so if you are a sailor expect plenty of time on the water and a wicked tan!
    In the evening you will join in with the camp activities, be it a rowdy campfire or activity night.
    Some of the skills we look for are listed below, however if you skill isn’t listed give us a call!
    Camps love new and exciting skill sets.
  </p>
  <h2>Support Staff</h2>
  <p>
    Support Staff are instrumental in the upkeep and day-to-day running of each Camp.
    Typically responsible for all important ‘behind the scenes’ activities, you will be tasked with all manner of maintenance duties, from painting, gardening to any other necessary practical work.
    You may also apply for an office-based Support Staff role, where you would be assisting the Camp Management with administrative tasks such as filing, word processing and other miscellaneous tasks.
    Housekeeping and Catering roles are also available, in which you would assist in cleaning or catering work.
    If you already have experience in any of the above or similar fields, then this could be the perfect role for you!
  </p>
  <h2>Special Needs Counsellor</h2>
  <p>
    Special Needs Counsellors work in the same way as General Camp Counsellors, though specifically with campers who have either learning/physical difficulties or specific requirements (e.g. behavioural/emotional disorders).
    In this role, it helps to be open-minded, patient and most importantly both kind-natured and caring.
    Whilst this may appear a challenging role, no previous experience is required and all necessary training will be provided.
    In addition to looking great on any CV, we guarantee that fulfilling this role will not only prove to be a rewarding and heartfelt experience – you’ll be making friends for life!
    In the words of one of our returning Special Needs Counsellors: ‘It’s campers we lead and teach each day, but in reality it’s they who teach us so much about ourselves!’
