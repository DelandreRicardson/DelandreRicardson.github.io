    <h1 class="columnLeft">Steps to Applying</h1>
      <h2>Step No. 1</h2>
      <p class="steps">
        To apply to the programme you must first fill out an application form, ensuring that you fill all parts correctly and truthfully. Once that is done HQ will review your application and, if you are a rockstar on paper, invite you to do an interview with either a member of staff or your local campus manager.
        At this stage you will need to pay the first payment towards your programme fee before your interview.
      </p>
      <h2>Step No. 2</h2>
      <p class="steps">
        Once the interview is done you will be told to write a creative personal essay and get two references forms completed.
        The essay is an essential part of your application.
        It is how the Camp Directors in Canada will get to know what kind of person you are on a personal level so make sure you talk about your skills and include a few photos of you doing them.
        The references cannot be from friends or family members and must contain active contact details so we can verify them.
        Teachers, employers or coaches are the best references to fill out the forms.
      </p>
      <h2>Step No. 3</h2>
      <p class="steps">
        This part of the process is when we work hard to match you with the best camp for you and then get you prepared to make your way to Canada.
        You will either be placed through our system or at one of our Camp Fairs.
        These fairs are great opportunities to have more control over the camp you will be placed at and have the possibility to be placed with a friend.
        At these fairs you will meet face to face with the Camp Directors and show off your amazing personality and brag about your skills.
        <br>
        Once you have been placed it is now time to make your final payment, get your medical and visa and book your flights.
        You do NOT have to attend an embassy interview to obtain your visa (unless you are planning to get the one year holiday visa or your camp says other wise).
        Visas are done online and you get it when you go through customs in Canada.
        Flights are quite easy too and we can get you in contact with our flight partner to help you book them.
        It is best to apply early so you can get placed earlier, book flights earlier and get a cheaper rate.
